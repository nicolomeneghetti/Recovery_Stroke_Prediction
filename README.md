# Recovery_Stroke_Prediction
All the codes contained in this repository were run in Matlab 2018b. 

This repository contains the codes to perform the classification algorithms described in "Post-stroke spontaneous motor recovery in mice can be predicted from acute-phase local field potential using machine learning"

The codes performing the Leave-One-Animal-Out classification of spontaneous motor recovery class from LFPs recordings in freely moving mice motor cortex is grouped into two folders: 
1) The validation and train procedures codes are in the "validation and train" folder
2) The test procedures codes are in the "validation and train" folder
