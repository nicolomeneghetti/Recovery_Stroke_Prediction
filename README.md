# Recovery_Stroke_Prediction
This repository contains the codes to perform the classification algorithms described in "Post-stroke spontaneous motor recovery in mice can be predicted from acute-phase local field potential using machine learning"

The main code performing the Leave-One-Animal-Out classification of spontaneous motor recovery class from LFPs recordings in freely moving mice motor cortex is contained in "LFP_LOAO_validation_classification.m"
